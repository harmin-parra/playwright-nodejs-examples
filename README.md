# playwright-nodejs-examples

These are the Cypress (https://example.cypress.io/) sample tests, but they have been rewritten into [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) (Node.js).

Be aware that some Cypress commands don't have an equivalent in Playwright, thus some workarounds are proposed whenever possible.

If you find a better solution or do you have an alternative solution to one of the tests, please share it with me by raising an [issue](https://github.com/harmin-parra/playwright-nodejs-examples/issues).
